Here you'll find content related to articles I wrote on Medium related to data science and python. This includes any code examples I use during walkthroughs that I do.

### [Getting API data and saving it to a SQL database](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-newspaper-article-data-and-saving-it-to-a-sql-database-651602ee929f)
In this article I talk about how to get data from the New York Times APIs (https://developers.nytimes.com/). I use the Archive API to get article data. My goal here was to showcase a great source of news data, show the basics of interacting with an API and saving the data to a database. 

### [Getting political polling data](https://towardsdatascience.com/political-polling-data-from-wikipedia-with-python-b71a9b291d7c)
In this article I talk about how to use Pandas to get tabular data directly from a website. Here I focus on political polling data, as that is an interest of mine, but it could be used for anything. The Pandas read_html() method worked really well. I played around with the 'flavor' parameter to get the best results.

### [Introduction to SQL using FPL data](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-sql-using-fpl-data-8314ec982308)
In this article I demonstrate the basics of SQL using Fantasy Premier League data. The queries run in the article can be found in the queries file. 

### [Using Requests with Python to Get Data from the FPL API](https://python.plainenglish.io/using-requests-with-python-to-get-data-from-the-fpl-api-4cb72f03a5d4)
In this article I demonstrate some of the basics of using the Requests library to interact with an API, including handling errors and JSON content. 

### [Getting and analysing chess data with Python](https://python.plainenglish.io/getting-and-analysing-chess-game-data-with-python-71c97494a5f4)
In this article I go over the steps I took to get my chess game data from the chess.com API and process it using python-chess and pandas for analysis.
